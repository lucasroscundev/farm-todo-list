# Farm Stack Todo List Project

This project was built as a means to learn, based upon the FARM Stack FreeCodeCamp video.
The link to the mentioned video is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWG7NlUDVaA&t=2059s

My intentions for creating this project were to learn: FastAPI and React, improve my understanding of: Git, GitHub and Docker, and deploy the result using a free tool. This project will become a part of my portfolio.

## But what is FARM?
The acronym stands for FastAPI (backend), React (frontend), and Mongodb (database).

## What other tools are needed for this project ?
Docker, Git, GitHub (or your preferred tool, such as GitLab), Python.

## Tools I've used not in the tutorial
Vite, Podman (alternative for Docker, changed half way), Shadcdn (and Tailwindcss)...

## Deployment
Not sure yet, but I'm leaning towards a combination of Vercel for the frontend, and for the backend, well...
Maybe Supabase, railway, netlify, or even deploying everything with Vercel.
Not yet so knowledgeable to launch it in AWS, but I'll get there.
